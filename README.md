# IT Home Lab - Week 1

## Lab Overview
Created a Windows Server 2022 lab to practice users, groups, and folder permissions, including a departmental folder simulation for HR and IT.

## Users
- User1 (GroupA / HR_Group)
- User2 (GroupB / IT_Group)
- User3 (no group)
- HR_User1, HR_User2 → HR_Group
- IT_User1, IT_User2 → IT_Group

## Groups
- GroupA, GroupB
- HR_Group, IT_Group

## Folders and Permissions
- C:\LabFolder → Full Control for GroupA
- C:\HR_Folder → Full Control for HR_Group
- C:\IT_Folder → Full Control for IT_Group
- Tested access for each user to verify permissions

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with Active Directory concepts
- Practiced creating users and groups
- Applied folder permissions to simulate role-based access control (RBAC)
- Simulated departmental access control for multiple groups
